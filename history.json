Let\u2019s focus on super quick wins. Here are a few ideas that fit the bill:\n\n1. *Yogurt Parfait:* Layer yogurt (Greek or regular) with granola and berries. Seriously, you can throw this together in under 5 minutes.\n\n2. *Toast with Nut Butter & Banana:* Toast a slice of bread, spread with your favorite nut butter (peanut, almond, cashew), and slice a banana on top.  Adds a little sweetness and protein.\n\n3. *Smoothie (Super Speedy):* Blend frozen berries, a banana, a scoop of protein powder (optional), and a splash of milk or yogurt. Seriously, you can do this in 3-5 minutes.\n\n4. *Hard-Boiled Egg & Toast:* If you have a pre-cooked hard-boiled egg, grab one and eat it with a piece of toast. \n\n5. *Cereal with Milk:* A classic for a reason! Choose a whole-grain cereal for a bit more fiber.\n\n*Which of these sounds most appealing to you right now? Or would you like me to give you a little more detail on one of them?* \n\nTo help me narrow it down, do you have any specific ingredients you\u2019re craving (like fruit, nuts, or something sweet)?"}]}
